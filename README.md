# "Cheat sheet"

Name | Formula | How to identify?
-- | -- | --
Constant | 1 | Number of elements in a collection does not matter. Algorithm always takes the same amount of time.
Logarithmic | log(n) | Doubling the number of elements does not double the processing power required to solve the problem.
Linear | n | Iteration through all elements in a collection
Quasilinear | n * log(n) | Sorting operations
Quadratic | n ^ 2 | Every element in a collection has to be compared to every other element (nested loops)
Exponential | 2 ^ n | By adding a single element to a collection, the required processing power doubles
